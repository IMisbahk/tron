# TRON: Symbolic Neural Model Framework

TRON is a modular symbolic cognition engine written in Python.  
It provides a flexible foundation for building evolving neural fields using pulse-based activation, dynamic clusters, and memory structures.

Inspired by the modularity and plasticity of the human brain, TRON treats intelligence as a field of interconnected, autonomous nodes. Each node maintains identity, activity, and symbolic lineage.

## Key Concepts

- **NodeField**: A dynamic graph of symbolic nodes and connections.
- **Nodes**: The smallest cognitive unit; stores state, receives pulses, emits signals.
- **NodeRoot**: Weighted directional connection between nodes.
- **Pulse**: Unit of signal propagation (analog, binary, or symbolic).
- **Clusters**: Modular logic, input, memory, and output structures built from nodes.
- **Scheduler**: Tick-based time controller for pulse propagation and learning.
- **Plasticity**: All connections support drift, adaptation, and runtime reconfiguration.

## Install

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/IMisbahK/tron.git
```

---

## Example

```python
from tron.engine import Node, NodeRoot, NodeField, Pulse

nodeA = Node()
nodeB = Node()

field = NodeField()
field.addNode(nodeA)
field.addNode(nodeB)

connection = NodeRoot(source=nodeA, target=nodeB, weight=0.8)
field.connectNodes(connection)

pulse = Pulse(strength=1.0)
nodeA.emitPulse(pulse)

field.tick()  
```
